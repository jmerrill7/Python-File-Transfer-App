Python Drill: PyDrill_gui_34_idle

Title: UI for File Transfer project - Python 3.4 - IDLE

Scenario: You recently created a script that will check a folder for new or modified files,
and then copy those new or modified files to another location.
Users are asking for a user interface to make using the script easier and more versatile.
Desired features of the UI:

 Allow the user to browse to and choose a specific folder that will contain the
files to be checked daily.
 Allow the user to browse to and choose a specific folder that will receive the
copied files.
 Allow the user to manually initiate the 'file check' process that is performed by
the script.
You have been asked to create this UI.

Guidelines:
 Use Python 3.4 for this drill.
 Use tkinter to create the UI.
 The layout of the UI is up to you.
 You should use IDLE for this Drill.

Once you create a functioning program that is approved by your instructor, save it for
later use. Do not modify this saved copy during subsequent drills.
